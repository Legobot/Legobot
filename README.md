## Introduction
Legobot is a platform which makes interactive IRC bots easy to build. The bot provides connectivity and the ability to listen and respond to users. The bot provides user functions a usable "message" object when needed, eliminating the need to parse raw IRC strings.

## Installation
Just run `pip install Legobot`. You can also install and run this as a non-privileged user by using `pip install --user Legobot` instead (recommended).

## Usage
Legobot is intended to be simple in usage, flexible, and allow the user to drive all functionality. Therefore it is a given that it doesn't do much on its own outside of managing the IRC connection and watching conversations. Any triggers and responses are yours to build. 

Legobot's primary functionality centers around a few methods:

First, let's initialize our bot:

```python
import Legobot
HOST = 'irc.freenode.com'
PORT = 6667
NICK = 'legobot'
CHANS = [('#freenoode',''),('#bitcoin',''),('#legobot','')] #List of tuples. Format is (channel,password)
myBot = Legobot.legoBot(host=HOST,port=PORT,nick=NICK,chans=CHANS)
```

#### Great, now what?

Write a function, add it to Legobot, then connect!

```python
def helloWorld(msg):
    return "Hello, world!"

myBot.addFunc("!helloworld", helloWorld, "Ask your bot to say hello. Usage: !helloworld")
mybot.connect(isSSL=False)
```

Then watch your creation come to life:

```
<bbriggs> !helloworld
<legobot> Hello, world!
<bbriggs> !help
<legobot> Available functions: !helloworld, !help
<bbriggs> !help !helloworld
<legobot> Ask your bot to say hello. Usage: !helloworld
```

Congratulations, you just wrote an IRC bot!

## API details

### Legobot class

#### Legobot.legobot()

`Legobot.legobot(host,port,nick,chans, logfunc = "", hostpw = "", defaultFunc = None, defaultFuncChar = "")`

*Parameters:*

**host** _String._ IRC host to connect to.

**port** _Int._ IRCd port to connect to (port IRC server is listening on).

**nick** _String._ Nickname you want your bot to use. Also sets realname value in IRC. 

**chans** _List._ This is actually a list of tuples in the form of (channel,channel_password). Example: [('#admins','supersecretpassword'),('#social','')]

**logfunc** _Function.__ Function object (without parens). logfunc is called with a msg objet for every line read in from irc. Essentially allowing a bot to log all conversations in the room. Can be useful for lookback bots.

**hostpw** _String._ Password for the IRCd, if necessary.

**defaultFunc** _Function.__ Function object (without parens). Supply a fallback function to trigger if your users ask for a function that doesn't exist. 

**defaultFuncChar** _String._ Predicating character for which to call your default func.  Typically bots are written to respond to a special character, eg: exclamation point. The bot would be expected to respond to things like !help, !tip, etc. defaultFunc and defaultFuncChar allow us to respond to unknown calls, eg !blah would then run the default function if there was not a function specifically written for !blah.

#### Legobot.addFunc()

`addFunc(self, name, function, helpText = "")`

*Parameters:*

**name** _String._ The word you want to trigger the function. Legobot only considers the first word in a message for this. Example: if name="!helloworld" and you say "!helloworld" in IRC, that will trigger the function. However, "will !helloworld work?" will not trigger the function.

**function** _Function._ Function object (without parens). It's usually helpful to name the function the same as the trigger. This is the function that gets called when the trigger word in the `name` parameter is seen.

**helpText** _String._ Describe in a few words what this function does. Gets displayed when user requests `!help !yourfunction` in IRC. 

#### `addDefaultFunc(self, func, char)`

*Parameters:*

**func** _Function._ Function object (without parens). Set the default, fallback function to trigger when users spam nonsense that starts with your trigger character. ie, `!xyzzy` could trigger `!help`. If you're not in the mood to be helpful, why not insult your users for being silly?

**char** _String._ Single character to serve as a trigger to let Legobot know we're talking to it. Example: setting `char` to `'!'` and just saying `!` in chat would trigger the default function. 

#### `connect(self, isSSL=False)`

*Parameters*

**isSSL** _Boolean._ Use SSL when connecting to the IRCd host

#### `sendMsg(self, msgToSend)`

*Parameters:*

**msgToSend** _String._ Line to send to IRC channel. 

### Message 

*Parameters:*

None.

Every line that comes in from the IRC connection generates a `Message` object in Legobot which is then parsed by the bot. Messages where the `Message.cmd` property (discussed below) matches a trigger will run the corresponding function. Legobot then passes the message object to the newly triggered function as a parameter. Example:

```python
def cointoss(msg):
    """
    Inputs:
      takes msg object

    Outputs:
      returns string to echo back to user in IRC

    Purpose:
      flip an imaginary coin or roll an imaginary N-sided die
      Usage:
      !roll [# of sides]
    """

    if not msg.arg1:
        toss = random.randint(0,1)
        if toss == 0:
            returnVal = "Heads"
        else:
            returnVal = "Tails"
    else:
        if not is_num(msg.arg1):
            returnVal = "Incorrect syntax. You must use a (sane) number"
        elif is_num(msg.arg1) and not int(msg.arg1) >= 2:
            returnVal = "Use at least two sides, weirdo."
        elif is_num(msg.arg1) and int(msg.arg1) == 2:
            toss = random.randint(1,2)
            if toss == 1:
                returnVal = "Heads"
            else:
                returnVal = "Tails"
        else:
            toss = random.randint(1,int(msg.arg1))
            returnVal = str(toss)
    return returnVal
```

Note: If you want your function to reply back to the channel or user the bot receieved from, return a just a string. To respond or forward to a specific channel, return a tuple of two strings in the form (message,channel_or_user)

### LegoBot Logging
Legobot will honor handlers/formatting for the python logging module.  For example if you were to do the following:

```python
import logging

# Set a file stream handler with info level threshold that only dumps out the message
logging.basicConfig(format="%(message)s", level=logging.INFO, filename="/path/to/file")
```
Legobot would then write using those parameters ot that filename.  If you don't wish to specify anything, by default Legobot will use a handler with the following format: 

```python
logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s - [%(name)s] - [%(levelname)s] - %(message)s", level = logging.INFO)
```
Example output:
```
2016-02-29 15:09:10,425 - [Legobot] - [INFO] - Attempting to log in with nick: test_bot
```


One important caveat here is that if you wish to define your own logging parameters, you must do so prior to creating your legobot object, on object creation we check for logging handlers and if one doesn't exist, we create it. After that you cannot use basicConfig anymore, it can only be used once.

**Properties:**

`Message.fullMessage`, _String._ full, raw IRC line. 

`Message.splitMessage`, _String._ IRC line split on whitespaces, truncated to 7 items. The 7th item is all remaining text, if it exists.

`Message.length`, _String._ The value of `len(self.splitMessage)`

`Message.userInfo`, _String._ The nick, realname, and host (or hostmask) of the IRC user who sent the message.

`Message.actualUserName`, _String._ Realname of IRC the user who sent the message. 

`Message.target`, _String._ where the message was addressed. ie, channel or individual user. Used to detect if message sent was a private message. 

`Message.cmd`, _String._ First word in user's actual message. In 'Hello world!', Message.cmd is 'Hello'

`Message.arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3`, _String._ Additional positional arguments to evaluate when parsing a triggered command. May or may not be present depending on the length of the input line. 

`Message.isPM`, _Boolean._ False if message was sent to whole #channel, True if sent to just the bot.
